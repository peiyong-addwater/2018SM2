Most current speech recognition systems use hidden Markov models (HMMs) to deal with the temporal variability of speech and Gaussian mixture models (GMMs) to determine how well each state of each HMM fits a frame or a short window of frames of coefficients that represents the acoustic input. An alternative way to evaluate the fit is to use a feed-forward neural network that takes several frames of coefficients as input and produces posterior probabilities over HMM states as output. Deep neural networks (DNNs) that have many hidden layers and are trained using new methods have been shown to outperform GMMs on a variety of speech recognition benchmarks, sometimes by a large margin. This article provides an overview of this progress and represents the shared views of four research groups that have had recent successes in using DNNs for acoustic modeling in speech recognition.

Therefore, the aim of this paper is to show the process of detection prototype DDoS attacks using a supervised learning model by Support Vector Machines (SVM), which captures network traffic, filters HTTP headers, normalizes the data on the basis of the operational variables: rate of false positives, rate of false negatives, rate of classification and then sends the information to corresponding SVM's training and testing sets. The results show that the proposed DDoS SVM prototype has high detection accuracy (99 {\%}) decrease of the false positives and false negatives rates compared to conventional detection models.",

Automatically detecting DDoS attack packets is one of the main defense mechanisms. Conventional solutions monitor network trafï¬c and identify attack activities from legitimate network trafï¬c based on statistical divergence. Machine learning is another method to improve identifying performance based on statistical features. However, conventional machine learning techniques are limited by the shallow representation models. In this paper, we propose a deep learning based DDoS attack detection approach (called DeepDefense). Deep learning approach can automatically extract high-level features from low-level ones and gain powerful representation and inference. We design a recurrent deep neural network to learn patterns from sequences of network trafï¬c and trace network attack activities. The experimental results demonstrate better performance of our model compared with conventional machine learning models. We reduce the error rate from 7.517\% to 2.103\% compared with conventional machine learning method in the larger data set.},

But as we know each technology has both advantages and disadvantages. One of the biggest disadvantages of cloud is security issue. There are many threats to the cloud security and Distributed Denial of Service (DDOS) attack is one of the severe threats. DDOS is a simple but a very powerful attack which makes the resources unavailable to the legitimate client. It is very hard to prevent this type of attack because of different types in which hacker may attack. Distinguishing between malicious and legitimate traffic is a tedious work and also manually filtering the traffic is not possible because of large number of hosts. Resource exhaustion is one of the most common attacks seen today and one of the best techniques would be to build intelligence to the machine so that it could proactively make decision and distinguish between good and bad traffic automatically. This is possible with machine learning techniques. In this paper we have discussed how machine learning can help us to prevent DDOS attack.},

	doi = {10.1016/j.neucom.2012.11.050},
	abstract = {With the rapid growth and the increasing complexity of network infrastructures and the evolution of attacks, identifying and preventing network abuses is getting more and more strategic to ensure an adequate degree of protection from both external and internal menaces. In this scenario many techniques are emerging for inspecting network trafï¬c and discriminating between anomalous and normal behaviors to detect undesired or suspicious activities. Unfortunately, the concept of normal or abnormal network behavior depends on several factors and its recognition requires the availability of a model aiming at characterizing current behavior, based on a statistical idealization of past events. There are two main challenges when generating the training data needed for effective modeling. First, network trafï¬c is very complex and unpredictable, and second, the model is subject to changes over time, since anomalies are continuously evolving. As attack techniques and patterns change, previously gained information about how to tell them apart from normal trafï¬c may be no longer valid. Thus, a desirable characteristic of an effective model for network anomaly detection is its ability to adapt to change and to generalize its behavior to multiple different network environments. In other words, a selflearning system is needed. This suggests the adoption of machine learning techniques to implement semisupervised anomaly detection systems where the classiï¬er is trained with ânormalâ trafï¬c data only, so that knowledge about anomalous behaviors can be constructed and evolve in a dynamic way. For this purpose we explored the effectiveness of a detection approach based on machine learning, using the Discriminative Restricted Boltzmann Machine to combine the expressive power of generative models with good classiï¬cation accuracy capabilities to infer part of its knowledge from incomplete training data.},

Companies like Google, Yahoo and Amazon are completely reliant on the Internet for their business. It is very hard to defend against these attacks because of the many different ways in which hackers may strike. Distinguishing between legitimate and malicious trafï¬c is a complex task. Setting up ï¬ltering by hand is often impossible due to the large number of hosts involved in the attack.},

In this paper, a DDoS detection model and defense system based on deep learning in SoftwareâDefined Network (SDN) environment are introduced. The model can learn patterns from sequences of network traffic and trace network attack activities in a historical manner. By using the defense system based on the model, the DDoS attack traffic can be effectively cleaned in SoftwareDefined Network. The experimental results demonstrate the much better performance of our model compared with conventional machine learning ways. It also reduces the degree of dependence on environment, simplifies the realtime update of detection system, and decreases the difficulty of upgrading or changing detection strategy.},

Multiagent Router Throttling has been demonstrated to perform well against DDoS attacks in small-scale network topologies. In this paper we tackle the scalability challenge. Scalability is arguably one of the most important aspects of a defence system since a non-scalable defence mechanism will never be adopted for wide deployment by a company or organisation. We introduce a novel design by incorporating several mechanisms; these are (i) team formation and role specialisation (ii) hierarchical communication (iii) task decomposition and (iv) reward shaping, and we show that our approach can signiï¬cantly scale-up. We compare our proposed approach against a baseline and a popular state of the art throttling technique from the literature and we show that it outperforms both of them.},

	abstract = {An increasing number of Internet of Things (IoT) devices are connecting to the Internet, yet many of these devices are fundamentally insecure, exposing the Internet to a variety of attacks. Botnets such as Mirai have used insecure consumer IoT devices to conduct distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks on critical Internet infrastructure. This motivates the development of new techniques to automatically detect consumer IoT attack trafï¬c. In this paper, we demonstrate that using IoT-speciï¬c network behaviors (e.g. limited number of endpoints and regular time intervals between packets) to inform feature selection can result in high accuracy DDoS detection in IoT network trafï¬c with a variety of machine learning algorithms, including neural networks. These results indicate that home gateway routers or other network middleboxes could automatically detect local IoT device sources of DDoS attacks using low-cost machine learning algorithms and trafï¬c data that is ï¬ow-based and protocol-agnostic.},

	abstract = {We propose a one-class neural network (OC-NN) model to detect anomalies in complex data sets. OC-NN combines the ability of deep networks to extract progressively rich representation of data with the one-class objective of creating a tight envelope around normal data. The OC-NN approach breaks new ground for the following crucial reason: data representation in the hidden layer is driven by the OC-NN objective and is thus customized for anomaly detection. This is a departure from other approaches which use a hybrid approach of learning deep features using an autoencoder and then feeding the features into a separate anomaly detection method like one-class SVM (OC-SVM). The hybrid OC-SVM approach is suboptimal because it is unable to influence representational learning in the hidden layers. A comprehensive set of experiments demonstrate that on complex data sets (like CIFAR and PFAM), OC-NN significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art anomaly detection methods.},

Traditional architecture of internet is vulnerable to DDoS attacks and it provides an opportunity to an attacker to gain access to a large number of compromised computers by exploiting their vulnerabilities to set up attack networks or Botnets. Once attack network or Botnet has been set up, an attacker invokes a large-scale, coordinated attack against one or more targets. Asa result of the continuous evolution of new attacks and ever-increasing range of vulnerable hosts on the internet, many DDoS attack Detection, Prevention and Traceback mechanisms have been proposed, In this paper, we tend to surveyed different types of attacks and techniques of DDoS attacks and their countermeasures. The significance of this paper is that the coverage of many aspects of countering DDoS attacks including detection, defence and mitigation, traceback approaches, open issues and research challenges.},
