1. Documentation is poor.
2. Too many if clauses in the method Fifteens and Runs, which makes 
   it extremely hard to debug. Also, the conditions in the if clause
   is too long.
3. The code is barely readable.
4. Poor organization.
5. Process-oriented programming instead of object-oriented. 
5. Code abstraction is poor.
6. Indentation is chaos. 
7. Switch should be used in methods getValue and toNumber instead if...
   else if... clause.
