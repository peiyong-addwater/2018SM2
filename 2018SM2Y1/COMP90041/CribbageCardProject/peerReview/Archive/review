1. The method to calculate runs is not completed.
2. The whole layout of the codes is very uncomfortalbe.
3. The format of the block comments for documentation for each method is not 
   appropriate. Should start with "/**" instead of "/*"
4. Indents in methods Nobs() and Fifteens() are not good.
5. Excessively long boolean expressions in the if clause in method
   Nobs(), which is barely readable.
6. The main method that calculates the scores from input cards should 
   not be put in the same class as the methods calculate scores from
   runs, ...etc.
7. On the whole, besides the unfinished runs method, the documentation
   is not bad besides its format, code is understandable, besides the 
   long if condition. However, the code is not very neat and organized,
   nor very simple or brief or well abstracted. Total code quality 
   is needed to be improved.
