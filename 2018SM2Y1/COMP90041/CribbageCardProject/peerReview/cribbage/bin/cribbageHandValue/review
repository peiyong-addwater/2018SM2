1. Format and style of documentation is not very good.
2. The sort method should be replaced the sort method in java standard libiary.
3. Names of the varialbes is not very readable.
4. Abstraction is not very good.
5. The way you handle string of input cards in method evaluatedHand is not very good. Actually the input is an array of strings instead of just a string.
6. In line 80: you can just call the methods for runs etc... instead of new a HandValue.
7. Indentation is not very pretty.
8. Method _15s is extremely unreadable
9. Variable naming is not very good.
